# casaos-password-reset
casaos password reset from "big-bear-scripts". I've just wanted to keep in here also. 

# How to use?
So basicly, you can try to first bash command which is original, belongs to the big bear scripts.
```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigbeartechworld/big-bear-scripts/master/reset-password-for-casaos/run.sh)"
```

and there is the second one;
```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigbeartechworld/big-bear-scripts/master/reset-password-for-casaos/run.sh)"(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bakruu/casaos-password-reset/refs/heads/main/run.sh)"
```
